## Overview

This repository contains C++ programs developed as part of the **CS 3060: Object-Oriented Programming with C++** course. Each assignment demonstrates core concepts of C++ programming, such as functions, structs, arrays, dynamic memory, and object-oriented design.

## Assignments

### 1. **Assignment 1: Kinetic Energy, Paint Job Estimator, and Stock Profit**
   - **Date:** 09/03/2024
   - **Description:** 
     - A collection of three different programs:
       1. **Kinetic Energy Calculator**: Calculates kinetic energy using mass and velocity.
       2. **Paint Job Estimator**: Estimates the total cost of a paint job based on room sizes and paint prices.
       3. **Stock Profit Calculator**: Computes the profit or loss from the sale of stock.
   - **Key Concepts:** Basic arithmetic operations, input/output, and decision-making.
   - **File:** [Assignment1.cpp](Assignment1.cpp)

### 2. **Assignment 2: Chips and Salsa, Monkey Business, and Grade Book**
   - **Date:** 09/12/2024
   - **Description:**
     - A set of three programs:
       1. **Chips and Salsa**: Calculates total sales and identifies the best and worst-selling salsa.
       2. **Monkey Business**: Tracks food consumption by monkeys over several days and computes averages.
       3. **Grade Book**: Manages students' grades and calculates averages and letter grades.
   - **Key Concepts:** Arrays, nested loops, and basic data analysis.
   - **File:** [Assignment2.cpp](Assignment2.cpp)

### 3. **Assignment 3: Search Benchmarks, Mode, and Median**
   - **Date:** 09/24/2024
   - **Description:**
     - This program allows users to choose between three options:
       1. **Search Benchmarks**: Performs linear and binary search and displays the number of comparisons.
       2. **Find Mode**: Identifies the mode of a set of random integers.
       3. **Find Median**: Finds the median value of a set of random integers.
   - **Key Concepts:** Sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and statistical computations.
   - **File:** [Assignment3.cpp](Assignment3.cpp)

### 4. **Assignment 4: Dynamic Search Benchmarks, Mode, and Median**
   - **Date:** 10/01/2024
   - **Description:**
     - An expanded version of Assignment 3 with dynamic memory allocation for arrays:
       1. **Dynamic Search Benchmarks**: Perform linear and binary searches using dynamically allocated arrays.
       2. **Find Mode with Dynamic Arrays**: Finds the mode(s) of a dynamic array of integers.
       3. **Find Median with Dynamic Arrays**: Finds the median value in a dynamic array.
   - **Key Concepts:** Dynamic memory allocation, sorting, and searching algorithms.
   - **File:** [Assignment4.cpp](Assignment4.cpp)

### 5. **Assignment 5: Password Verifier and Customer Account Program**
   - **Date:** 10/08/2024
   - **Description:**
     - Two separate programs:
       1. **Password Verifier**: Validates user passwords based on length, and character requirements.
       2. **Customer Account Program**: Manages customer account records, including adding, searching, and editing records.
   - **Key Concepts:** String manipulation, input validation, and struct-based data management.
   - **File:** [Assignment5.cpp](Assignment5.cpp)

### 6. **Assignment 6: Monthly Budget, Drink Machine Simulator, and Inventory Bins**
   - **Date:** 10/15/2024
   - **Description:**
     - Three programs to simulate common tasks:
       1. **Monthly Budget**: Allows the user to input monthly expenses and compare them to a predefined budget.
       2. **Drink Machine Simulator**: Simulates a vending machine with different drink choices and tracks earnings.
       3. **Inventory Bins**: Manages an inventory of parts with options to add or remove items.
   - **Key Concepts:** Structs, arrays, input validation, and simulation.
   - **File:** [Assignment6.cpp](Assignment6.cpp)

### 7. **Assignment 7: String Search, Array to File, and Corporate Sales Data**
   - **Date:** 10/22/2024
   - **Description:**
     - A set of three programs:
       1. **String Search in a File**: Prompts the user for a file name and a string, searches for the string in the file, and displays all occurrences along with the number of occurrences.
       2. **Array to File and File to Array**: Writes an integer array to a binary file, then reads the array back and displays its contents.
       3. **Corporate Sales Data**: Prompts the user to enter sales data for four divisions over four quarters, stores the data, and writes it to a file. The program then reads and displays the data.
   - **Key Concepts:** File input/output, string manipulation, binary file handling, and struct-based data management.
   - **File:** [Assignment7.cpp](Assignment7.cpp)
